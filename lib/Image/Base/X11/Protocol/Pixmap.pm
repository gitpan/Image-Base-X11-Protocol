=head1 CLASS HIERARCHY

C<Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap> is a subclass of
C<Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Drawable>,

    Image::Base
      Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Drawable
        Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap> extends C<Image::Base> to create and
draw into X pixmaps by sending drawing requests to an X server using
C<X11::Protocol>.  There's no file load or save, just drawing operations.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<$image = Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap-E<gt>new (key=E<gt>value,...)>

Create and return a new image object.  An existing pixmap can be used,
usually with a colormap for where to allocate colours.

    $image = Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap->new
                 (-X        => $x11_protocol_obj,
                  -pixmap   => $pixmap_xid,
                  -colormap => $colormap_xid);

Or a new pixmap can be created,

    $image = Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap->new
                 (-X      => $x11_protocol_obj,
                  -width  => 100,
                  -height => 100);  # default screen and depth

A pixmap requires a size, screen and depth, plus a colormap if allocating
colours instead of making a bitmap or similar.  The default is the
C<X11::Protocol> object's current C<choose_screen> and the depth of the root
window on that screen, or desired settings can be applied with

    -screen   => integer screen number
    -depth    => integer bits per pixel
    -colormap => integer XID

If C<-depth> is given and it's not the screen's default depth then there's
no default colormap (since the screen's default would be wrong).  This
happens when creating a bitmap,

    $image = Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Pixmap->new
                 (-width   => 10,
                  -height  => 10,
                  -depth   => 1);  # bitmap, no colormap

The following further helper options can create a pixmap for use with a
particular window or another pixmap,

    -for_drawable =>  integer XID
    -for_window   =>  integer XID

C<-for_drawable> means the depth and screen of that pixmap or window.
C<-for_window> likewise and in addition the colormap fetched from it per
C<GetWindowAttributes>.  Getting this information is a server round-trip
(except for a root window) so if you already know those things then passing
them as C<-screen>, C<-depth> and C<-colormap> is faster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

See C<Image::Base::X11::Protocol::Drawable> for the base drawable attributes
inherited.

=over

=item C<-pixmap> (XID integer)

The target pixmap.  C<-drawable> and C<-pixmap> access the same attribute.

=item C<-width> (integer, read-only)

=item C<-height> (integer, read-only)

The size of a pixmap cannot be changed once created.

The maximum size allowed by the protocol is 32767x32767, and minimum 1x1.
When creating a pixmap currently the sizes are chopped by Perl's C<pack> to
a signed 16 bits, which means 32768 to 65535 results in an X protocol error
(being negatives), but for instance 65546 wraps around to 10 and will seem
to work.
